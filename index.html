      <h2>Why we chose The Department of the Interior</h2>
      <p>
        Me and my groupmates were given the task to redesign a government agency website and we chose The Department of the Interior because we were able to find a few navigation and accessibility issues which we are confident that we can improve.

Although the website's current layout is not terrible, we were able to brainstorm on different ways that we can revamp it.

        <h2>My Role </h2>
        <p>Me and my groupmates were given the task to redesign a non-profit organization's website and we chose homelesshouston.org because we were able to find a few navigation and accessibility issues which we are confident that we can improve.

          With our whole team being in Houston, we heavily connect with The Coalition for the Homeless' core values.</p>

  <h2>Problem Statement and the Solution</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg">
        <h3>The Problem:</h3>
        <p>Users have trouble navigating and locating information from the website because the information structure of the website is confusing and ambiguous.</p>
        <h3>The Solution:</h3>
        <p>By organizing the information in a clean and cohesive format, users will have an easier time navigating and searching for more information about the Department of the Interior's core values, resources, etc.</p>

<!--User Research-->
<h2>User Research</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg">
  <p>First , we let 5 users perform a usability testing. They were given a randomized set of tasks that involves locating information and button navigation.

    Overall, here is what our users said:</p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg">
  <p>insert image</p>
</div>
<h3>“...the website was easier to navigate compared to other government websites and it wasn’t an eye sore. It took me a minute to click on the right link but easy to find.”

  “...the volunteer page was a little confusing. I had to scroll all the way down to locate the ‘Volunteer Pass’ when I clicked on Volunteer opportunities.”
  
  “I love the color scheme! The homepage was confusing, I didn’t really know what I was looking at, it took a few tries to have the website feel user-friendly.”
  
  “The pictures felt weird, I feel like I am looking at a gallery of stock Nat Geo images”
  </h3>
