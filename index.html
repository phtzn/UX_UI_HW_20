      <h2>Why we chose The Department of the Interior</h2>
      <br><br>
      <p>
        Me and my groupmates were given the task to redesign a government agency website and we chose The Department of the Interior because we were able to find a few navigation and accessibility issues which we are confident that we can improve.

Although the website's current layout is not terrible, we were able to brainstorm on different ways that we can revamp it.

        <p>Me and my groupmates were given the task to redesign a non-profit organization's website and we chose homelesshouston.org because we were able to find a few navigation and accessibility issues which we are confident that we can improve.

          With our whole team being in Houston, we heavily connect with The Coalition for the Homeless' core values.</p>
